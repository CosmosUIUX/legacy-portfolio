# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Legacy Interiors and Developers application by integrating Motion.dev components to create more sophisticated, performant, and visually appealing animations. The current application uses Framer Motion extensively, but Motion.dev offers advanced animation capabilities, better performance, and more modern animation patterns that will elevate the user experience.

The enhancement will replace key Framer Motion implementations with Motion.dev equivalents while maintaining the existing design aesthetic and improving animation performance and visual appeal.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to experience smooth, modern animations when navigating and interacting with the site, so that I feel engaged and impressed by the professional quality of the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads any page THEN the system SHALL display smooth entrance animations using Motion.dev components
2. WHEN the user scrolls through content THEN the system SHALL trigger reveal animations that are more performant than the current Framer Motion implementation
3. WHEN the user hovers over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback through Motion.dev hover animations
4. WHEN animations are playing THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance on modern devices
5. WHEN the user has reduced motion preferences THEN the system SHALL respect accessibility settings and reduce or disable animations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the hero section to have cinematic-quality animations, so that I'm immediately captivated by the brand's attention to detail and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the system SHALL display a sophisticated entrance animation using Motion.dev's advanced animation capabilities
2. WHEN the user scrolls in the hero section THEN the system SHALL provide smooth parallax effects using Motion.dev scroll-triggered animations
3. WHEN the animated text appears THEN the system SHALL use Motion.dev's text animation features for more fluid character-by-character reveals
4. WHEN the background image loads THEN the system SHALL apply cinematic scaling and positioning effects
5. WHEN the info strip appears THEN the system SHALL use Motion.dev's stagger animations for the feature icons

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want product cards and interactive elements to have polished micro-interactions, so that the interface feels responsive and premium.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views product cards THEN the system SHALL display them with Motion.dev's layout animations and smooth transitions
2. WHEN the user hovers over product cards THEN the system SHALL provide sophisticated hover effects using Motion.dev's interaction capabilities
3. WHEN product cards enter the viewport THEN the system SHALL animate them in with staggered timing using Motion.dev's viewport animations
4. WHEN the user interacts with buttons and form elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate tactile feedback through Motion.dev animations
5. WHEN the user opens modals or overlays THEN the system SHALL use Motion.dev's presence animations for smooth enter/exit transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want navigation and menu interactions to feel fluid and intuitive, so that moving through the site is effortless and enjoyable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the mobile menu THEN the system SHALL display a smooth slide-in animation using Motion.dev components
2. WHEN the user scrolls and the header changes state THEN the system SHALL provide smooth background and opacity transitions
3. WHEN the user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL use Motion.dev's page transition capabilities
4. WHEN menu items appear THEN the system SHALL stagger their entrance using Motion.dev's sequence animations
5. WHEN the user closes the menu THEN the system SHALL provide a smooth exit animation with proper cleanup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the Motion.dev integration to be well-structured and maintainable, so that future enhancements and debugging are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Motion.dev is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain clean separation between animation logic and component logic
2. WHEN new animations are added THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns and naming conventions
3. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN the system SHALL have proper TypeScript types for all Motion.dev components
4. WHEN animations are implemented THEN the system SHALL include proper error boundaries and fallbacks
5. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL optimize Motion.dev imports to minimize bundle size

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor using assistive technologies, I want animations to be accessible and not interfere with my browsing experience, so that I can navigate the site effectively regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has motion sensitivity preferences THEN the system SHALL respect prefers-reduced-motion settings
2. WHEN screen readers are active THEN the system SHALL ensure animations don't interfere with content accessibility
3. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus management during animations
4. WHEN animations are playing THEN the system SHALL not cause content to flash or strobe in ways that could trigger seizures
5. WHEN the user interacts with animated elements THEN the system SHALL provide alternative interaction methods for users who cannot see animations
