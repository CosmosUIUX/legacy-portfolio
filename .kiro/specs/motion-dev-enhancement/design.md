# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the integration of Motion.dev components into the Legacy Interiors and Developers application. Motion.dev provides advanced animation capabilities with better performance characteristics than traditional Framer Motion implementations. The design focuses on replacing key animation components while maintaining the existing visual aesthetic and improving performance.

The integration will be implemented incrementally, starting with core animation utilities and progressively enhancing key components like the hero section, product cards, and navigation elements.

## Architecture

### Motion.dev Integration Strategy

The application will adopt Motion.dev's component-based architecture while maintaining compatibility with existing Framer Motion code during the transition period. The integration follows these principles:

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Replace Framer Motion components incrementally
2. **Performance First**: Utilize Motion.dev's optimized animation engine
3. **Accessibility**: Leverage Motion.dev's built-in accessibility features
4. **Type Safety**: Maintain full TypeScript support throughout

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Core Animation System

#### MotionProvider Component

```typescript
interface MotionProviderProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  reducedMotion?: boolean;
  performanceMode?: "high" | "balanced" | "battery";
}
```

Provides global animation configuration and accessibility settings.

#### Enhanced Animation Hooks

```typescript
interface UseMotionOptions {
  trigger?: "viewport" | "hover" | "click" | "scroll";
  duration?: number;
  easing?: string;
  delay?: number;
  stagger?: number;
}
```

### 2. Hero Section Enhancement

#### Cinematic Text Animation

- Replace character-by-character animation with Motion.dev's advanced text effects
- Implement smooth word-level reveals with proper spacing
- Add cinematic easing curves for professional feel

#### Parallax Background System

- Utilize Motion.dev's scroll-triggered animations for background elements
- Implement multi-layer parallax with different scroll speeds
- Add subtle rotation and scale effects during scroll

#### Info Strip Animation

- Replace current stagger animation with Motion.dev's sequence animations
- Add icon-specific entrance effects (slide, fade, scale)
- Implement hover micro-interactions for each info item

### 3. Product Card System

#### Layout Animation Engine

```typescript
interface ProductCardMotionProps {
  product: Product;
  layoutId: string;
  onQuickLook: (product: Product) => void;
  animationPreset?: "subtle" | "dynamic" | "cinematic";
}
```

#### Interaction States

- **Idle**: Subtle breathing animation using Motion.dev's loop capabilities
- **Hover**: Sophisticated lift effect with shadow and scale transforms
- **Active**: Press animation with haptic-like feedback
- **Loading**: Skeleton animation with shimmer effects

### 4. Navigation Enhancement

#### Mobile Menu System

- Replace slide-in animation with Motion.dev's presence animations
- Implement backdrop blur animation synchronized with menu appearance
- Add staggered menu item reveals with bounce effects

#### Header State Transitions

- Smooth background opacity changes using Motion.dev's state animations
- Logo and text color transitions based on scroll position
- Micro-interactions for menu button states

### 5. Form and Input Enhancement

#### Input Field Animations

- Focus state animations with smooth border and shadow transitions
- Label floating animations using Motion.dev's layout animations
- Error state animations with shake and color transitions

#### Button Interactions

- Press animations with realistic depth effects
- Loading state animations with spinner integration
- Success/error feedback animations

## Data Models

### Animation Configuration

```typescript
interface AnimationConfig {
  id: string;
  component: string;
  trigger: AnimationTrigger;
  properties: AnimationProperties;
  accessibility: AccessibilityOptions;
}

interface AnimationTrigger {
  type: "viewport" | "hover" | "click" | "scroll" | "focus";
  threshold?: number;
  rootMargin?: string;
}

interface AnimationProperties {
  duration: number;
  easing: string;
  delay?: number;
  stagger?: number;
  transform?: TransformProperties;
  opacity?: OpacityProperties;
}

interface AccessibilityOptions {
  respectReducedMotion: boolean;
  skipOnScreenReader: boolean;
  alternativeText?: string;
}
```

### Performance Metrics

```typescript
interface AnimationMetrics {
  componentId: string;
  renderTime: number;
  frameRate: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  batteryImpact: "low" | "medium" | "high";
}
```

## Error Handling

### Animation Fallbacks

1. **Motion.dev Load Failure**: Graceful degradation to CSS transitions
2. **Performance Issues**: Automatic reduction of animation complexity
3. **Accessibility Conflicts**: Immediate animation disabling with user notification
4. **Memory Constraints**: Progressive animation disabling based on device capabilities

### Error Boundary Implementation

```typescript
interface AnimationErrorBoundaryProps {
  fallback: React.ComponentType;
  onError?: (error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) => void;
}
```

Wraps animated components to prevent animation failures from breaking the entire application.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- **Animation Logic**: Test animation configuration and timing
- **Accessibility**: Verify reduced motion preferences are respected
- **Performance**: Validate frame rate and memory usage within acceptable limits
- **Fallbacks**: Ensure graceful degradation works correctly

### Integration Testing

- **Component Interactions**: Test animations between different components
- **Scroll Behavior**: Validate scroll-triggered animations across different viewport sizes
- **State Transitions**: Test animation behavior during component state changes
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensure consistent behavior across supported browsers

### Performance Testing

- **Frame Rate Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during animation playback
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Verify proper cleanup of animation resources
- **Battery Impact Assessment**: Measure power consumption on mobile devices
- **Bundle Size Analysis**: Monitor impact on application load time

### Accessibility Testing

- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Verify animations don't interfere with assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test focus management during animations
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Validate reduced motion preferences are properly implemented
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure animated elements maintain accessibility standards
